# Vue3 Developer DAO NFT Viewer example

Online at: [https://devdao.raz.works/#/](https://devdao.raz.works/#/)

This is made by using [my dapp-starter](https://github.com/RazorSiM/vue-dapp-starter)

## What's this?

This is a tool to show the nfts minted from the **Devs for Revolution** ERC721 smart contract:

 - [Github Link](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/developer-dao-nft-contract)
 - [Etherscan Link](https://etherscan.io/address/0x25ed58c027921e14d86380ea2646e3a1b5c55a8b#code)

## How it works

You input the ID of the nft you want to look at and wait for the result to show up ðŸ¤¯
If the token ID does not exists, the UI will show you how much It would cost to mint the token and give you the chance to mint It.

PS: You need to connect to Metamask to be able to mint and check the gas estimation
